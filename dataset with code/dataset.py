input3="I express my heartfelt gratitude to the gracious Allah, whose blessings and mercy have enabled me to successfully conclude this thesis. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my supervisor for his invaluable guidance, comments, and suggestions throughout the course of the thesis. I greatly appreciate his continuous support and encouragement. Thank you very much. In the realm of emergency response, the accuracy and timeliness of information dissemination play a pivotal role in minimizing damages and ensuring public safety. Traditional emergency reporting systems often suffer from challenges such as delayed response, misinformation, and a lack of user engagement. To address these limitations, we present a novel emergency post-detection system that harnesses blockchain technology, Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), and a reward-penalty framework to enhance accuracy, transparency, and user involvement. The system operates as a decentralized platform that empowers users to report and verify emergency events in real-time. ECC is employed for secure user identification, generating digital signatures to validate event submissions. The blockchain provides a tamper-resistant ledger, ensuring the immutability and integrity of reported events. A unique incentive structure rewards users for providing accurate information while penalizing the dissemination of false reports, promoting responsible and ethical behavior. This paper delineates the architectural components of the system, including user registration, event submission, verification, and dissemination stages. Verified events are seamlessly broadcasted to the public through a decentralized feed, augmenting public awareness and preparedness. The system's scalability and ability to accommodate a growing user base make it a promising candidate for revolutionizing emergency reporting systems. By mitigating challenges related to data privacy, accuracy, user engagement, and real-time responsiveness, this proposed system aims to redefine the landscape of emergency reporting and response mechanisms. Through the synergy of emerging technologies and innovative incentives, it has the potential to significantly bolster public safety, facilitate efficient emergency management, and establish a foundation for a more informed and empowered community. Current emergency reporting systems face challenges like inaccurate reporting, delayed responses, and limited engagement. The lack of reliable event validation and user "

Our car will maintain its own velocity observing relative velocity of its front vehicle. In case of the appearing car behind, we will set also a stereo camera at the backside of our car that observes the velocity of the backward car. If our car speed is less than that one then it will try to move left and let the car go forward. Using OpenCV the model car detects traffic signs and take action accordingly. In case of footpath transportation, assuming that our car is fit at the footpath, the car will always try to move forward from the left side of the lane, whenever a person appears in front of the model car it will stop or decrease the speed. And search space at the right side, if it finds out the space then it will overtake the person and come back again left side. If it doesn’t find any space on the right side it provides a horn. A Raspberry Pi based framework for a self-driving model car is proposed, which can handle four tasks: a. Self-driving car model moves on a pre-defined track autonomously, being capable of driving in three directions: straight, left or right. b.

input6="Peace journalism is distinguished from more conventional approaches to conflict reporting by its incorporation of a number of essential components. These components, when taken together, help to a more complete and nuanced understanding of conflicts, bring attention to alternatives that do not include violence, and encourage constructive communication among parties that are at odds with one another. The practise of Peace Journalism seeks to promote peace, reconciliation, and the transformation of conflict through the use of these components. The following are the primary components of peace journalism: Conflict sensitivity is the recognition by peace journalism of the complex and multifaceted character of conflicts. It highlights how vital it is for journalists to have sensitivity to the historical, cultural, and social elements that lurk beneath conflicts. In order to accomplish this, a comprehensive understanding of the underlying causes, power imbalances, and views of the various players involved is required. Peace journalism attempts to present a more realistic and contextually rich portrayal of conflicts by being aware of these intricacies and working to account for them appropriately. Peace journalism is more than just reporting on acts of violence and casualties; it seeks to find constructive solutions. It aggressively seeks for and highlights positive approaches to dispute resolution as well as non-violent alternatives to conflict resolution. Peace Journalism seeks to promote hope and stimulate conversation by highlighting the actions of peacemakers, grassroots initiatives, and solutions for peacebuilding. As an alternative to continuing the vicious cycle of violence, it provides narratives that place an emphasis on reconciliation, dialogue, and long-term solutions.: Peace journalism places a major emphasis on amplifying the voices of those who are directly affected by conflicts, particularly the voices of marginalised groups and victims who are frequently disregarded or suppressed. Through the provision of a forum in which these voices can be heard, Peace Journalism poses a challenge to established narratives and power structures. This "

Examples include the work of the Media High Council in Rwanda, the Peace Journalism Foundation in South Africa, and the Independent Radio Network in Sierra Leone. These are just a few examples of how Peace Journalism has been practiced in real-life situations. The commitment of journalists and media organizations to the principles of Peace Journalism has helped to create spaces for dialogue, understanding, and reconciliation, contributing to the broader efforts of peacebuilding and conflict transformation.War Journalism can be observed in various real-life situations where conflicts and wars have been extensively covered by the media. Some notable examples include: 1. Coverage of the Vietnam War: The Vietnam War witnessed intense media coverage, with journalists on the ground providing regular updates on the conflict. News outlets like The New York Times, CBS, and NBC extensively reported on battles, casualties, and military strategies. The graphic imagery and narratives depicting the violence and impact of the war had a profound impact on public perception and played a role in shaping anti-war sentiment.2. Reporting on the Iraq War: The media coverage of the Iraq War, particularly during the initial invasion in 2003, exemplified certain aspects of War Journalism. The emphasis on dramatic military operations, embedded reporting with the military, and the portrayal of the conflict as a fight between good and evil contributed to a simplified narrative. Critics argued that these components overshadowed critical analysis of the war's justifications and long-term consequences. 3. Conflict Reporting in Syria: The ongoing conflict in Syria has witnessed extensive media coverage, with journalists reporting on the violence, humanitarian crises, and the involvement of various factions.

input13="image within the patch The dark channel prior can be used for deblurring by assuming that the low values in the dark channel are caused by the haze or blur in the image. By estimating the haze or blur in the dark channel, it is possible to recover the underlying sharp image.By applying the inverse Fourier transform of the dark channel and thresholding the resulting image they obtain an estimate of the PSF. The estimated PSF is used to deconvolve the blurred image and recover the sharp image. This approach to solving the blurring issue is quite effective, and less computation is needed with respect to the CNN approach. It’s quite fast. But there are some issues to address while using the approach, The dark channel prior can be sensitive to noise in the image which may generate inappropriate results in the deblurred image if an image contains any noise. In some cases, the dark channel prior may overestimate the extent of blur in an image, especially in regions that are naturally dark.Cows are found in many colors, such as white, black and red.

input14=" His red eyes scanned the lobby as he entered the residence. Empty. He climbed the stairs quietly, not wanting to awaken any of his fellow numeraries. His bedroom door was open; locks were forbidden here. He entered, closing the door behind him. The room was spartan—hardwood floors, a pine dresser, a canvas mat in the corner that served as his bed. He was a visitor here this week, and yet for many years he had been blessed with a similar sanctuary in New York City. The Lord has provided me shelter and purpose in my life. Tonight, at last, Silas felt he had begun to repay his debt. Hurrying to the dresser, he found the cell phone hidden in his bottom drawer and placed a call. Yes? a male voice answered.Teacher, I have returned.Speak, the voice commanded, sounding pleased to hear from him. All four are gone. The three sénéchaux... and the Grand Master himself. There was a momentary pause, as if for prayer. Then I assume you have the information? All four concurred. Independently. And you believed them? Their agreement was too great for coincidence. An excited breath. Excellent. I had feared the brotherhood's reputation for secrecy might prevail. The prospect of death is strong motivation. So, my pupil, tell me what I must know. Silas knew the information he had gleaned from his victims would come as a shock. Teacher, all four confirmed the existence of the clef de voûte... the legendary keystone. He heard a quick intake of breath over the phone and could feel the Teacher's excitement. The keystone. Exactly as we suspected. According to lore, the brotherhood had created a map of stone—a clef de voûte... or keystone—an engraved tablet that revealed the final resting place of the brotherhood's greatest secret."

This is especially important in underserved or remote areas where access to healthcare facilities and trained professionals is limited. It has a great role in patient comfort and convenience as traditional methods of hemoglobin measurement often involve needle pricks and blood draws, which can be uncomfortable, painful, and anxiety-inducing for patients, particularly children and individuals with needle phobia. It can be widely used for more frequent monitoring of hemoglobin levels. Regular monitoring is especially beneficial for patients with chronic conditions that affect hemoglobin levels. Invasive blood tests carry a risk of infection at the injection site, as well as other potential complications. Non-invasive methods eliminate these risks, promoting patient safety and reducing the likelihood of healthcare-associated infections. It is especially beneficial for vulnerable populations like children and the elderly. Children may be more cooperative when undergoing non-invasive procedures, and elderly individuals often have fragile veins that make traditional blood draws challenging. It could be used in telemedicine platform also. Telemedicine platforms can incorporate non invasive hemoglobin measurement tools, allowing healthcare providers to remotely monitor patients' hemoglobin levels and make timely recommendations. Non-invasive methods can potentially reduce the costs associated with invasive blood tests, which require trained personnel, specialized equipment, and proper disposal procedures for bio hazardous materials.
